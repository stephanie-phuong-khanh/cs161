(1) No, the graph is UNSATISFIABLE for SAT instance of graph1.txt with 3 colors.

(2) Yes, the SAT instance is SATISFIABLE with 4 colors.

(3) The results to (1) and (2) tell me that the graph coloring problem of the graph described by graph1.txt
is solvable with a minimum of 4 colors. An example coloring with four colors RED, BLUE, GREEN, YELLOW is as follows:
    NODE - COLOR
    1   -   RED
    2   -   BLUE
    3   -   YELLOW
    4   -   RED
    5   -   BLUE
    6   -   YELLOW
    7   -   GREEN

(4) The graph coloring problem of the graph of graph2.txt is solvable with a minimum of 8 colors.
